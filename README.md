>__Project Description__: 
>_The integrative study of omics data and genetic variants shed light on the cellular and molecular process at each single nucleotide level, which is essential for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases. Thousands of publicly available omics data-epigenome, transcriptome and methylome  data,  offer  a  unique  opportunity  to  annotate variant,  making  the  interpretation  and  identification  of  variants  feasible.  However, there  is  a  severe  lack  of  advanced  computational methods and efficient software tailored to variants in particular context such as disease, tissue or cell  type.  we  propose  to  develop  an  integrative  database  and  online  web  server  that  offers comprehensive omics annotations to the context-specific functional variants from context-relevant diseases, tissues or cell types._
